    "tuff": "Tuff is a rock formed from volcanic ash and debris that have been compacted and solidified after an eruption, with a porous and irregular texture reflecting its explosive origin.",
    "chert": "Chert is a very hard sedimentary rock composed of tightly compacted microcrystalline quartz, typically formed in marine environments with a shiny, uniform texture.",
    "diorite": "Diorite is an igneous rock characterized by medium-sized mineral crystals formed from relatively rapid cooling of magma, displaying a natural mix of light and dark minerals.",
    "dolomite": "Dolomite is a rock composed mainly of calcium and magnesium carbonate, similar to limestone but with a distinct chemical composition and a moderately firm texture.",
    "gabbro": "Gabbro is a coarse-grained igneous rock that forms deep underground as magma cools slowly, typically dark in color and extremely durable.",
    "marl": "Marl is a sedimentary rock formed from a mixture of clay and calcium carbonate, exhibiting a smooth texture with subtle color variations.",
    "obsidian": "Obsidian is a volcanic glass formed when lava cools extremely quickly, resulting in a smooth, glass-like surface with sharp edges.",
    "pumice": "Pumice is a lightweight volcanic rock formed when lava cools rapidly and traps numerous gas bubbles, giving it a unique, porous, bubbly texture.",
    "rhyolite": "Rhyolite is a volcanic rock with a fine-grained structure formed from quickly cooled lava, typically exhibiting a light tone and rich in quartz and feldspar.",
    "scoria": "Scoria is a vesicular volcanic rock formed from gas-rich lava that solidifies with many bubbles, featuring a rough, porous texture and dark color.",
    "slate": "Slate is a metamorphic rock derived from shale that has been transformed under heat and pressure, splitting easily into thin, finely foliated layers.",
    "agate": "Agate is a variety of chalcedony known for its unique banded patterns and vibrant colors, featuring intricate designs and a glossy, smooth finish.",
    "calcite": "Calcite is a crystalline mineral composed mainly of calcium carbonate, forming transparent or translucent crystals that reflect light in various hues.",
