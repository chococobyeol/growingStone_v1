  "stoneDescriptions": {
    "andesite": "Andesite is a volcanic rock formed when lava cools quickly after an eruption. It features a fine crystal structure and usually displays a range of gray tones. Composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene, it offers a balanced strength and durability.",
    "basalt": "Basalt is a dark igneous rock created when lava cools very rapidly. Its texture is uniform due to tightly packed tiny crystals, giving it exceptional toughness and making it one of the most common rocks in the Earth's crust.",
    "conglomerate": "Conglomerate is a sedimentary rock made up of various rounded rock fragments and gravel, naturally cemented together by sand and clay. The mix of different sized clasts tells a story of long-term erosion and transport in dynamic environments.",
    "gneiss": "Gneiss is a metamorphic rock formed from pre-existing rocks that have been subjected to high temperatures and pressures over time. It is characterized by striking banded patterns with minerals aligned in distinct layers, reflecting its transformation history.",
    "granite": "Granite is an intrusive igneous rock that forms deep underground as magma cools slowly. It contains visible crystals of quartz, feldspar, and mica, resulting in a very hard and durable rock that stands the test of time.",
    "limestone": "Limestone is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of calcite, formed from the accumulation of marine organisms' remains such as shells and corals. Its smooth texture and occasional fossil traces capture the essence of ancient sea environments.",
    "quartzite": "Quartzite is a hard metamorphic rock formed from quartz-rich sandstone that has been transformed by intense heat and pressure. Its shiny, dense surface and excellent resistance to weathering make it one of nature's toughest rocks.",
    "sandstone": "Sandstone is a sedimentary rock formed by the gradual compaction and cementation of sand particles. It comes in a variety of colors and textures, with its appearance reflecting the conditions of its formation over time.",
    "shale": "Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock composed of compacted clay and silt. Known for its tendency to split into thin layers, it provides clear evidence of slow, quiet deposition in low-energy environments.",
    "tuff": "Tuff is a type of rock formed from volcanic ash and debris that have been compacted and solidified after an eruption. Its porous and irregular texture, along with its varied coloration, reflects the explosive nature of its volcanic origin."
