  "stoneDescriptions": {
    "andesite": "Andesite is a volcanic rock formed when lava cools quickly after an eruption. It features a fine crystal structure and usually displays a range of gray tones. Composed mainly of plagioclase and pyroxene, it offers a balanced strength and durability.",
    "basalt": "Basalt is a dark igneous rock created when lava cools very rapidly. Its texture is uniform due to tightly packed tiny crystals, giving it exceptional toughness and making it one of the most common rocks in the Earth's crust.",
    "conglomerate": "Conglomerate is a sedimentary rock made up of various rounded rock fragments and gravel, naturally cemented together by sand and clay. The mix of different sized clasts tells a story of long-term erosion and transport in dynamic environments.",
    "gneiss": "Gneiss is a metamorphic rock formed from pre-existing rocks that have been subjected to high temperatures and pressures over time. It is characterized by striking banded patterns with minerals aligned in distinct layers, reflecting its transformation history.",
    "granite": "Granite is an intrusive igneous rock that forms deep underground as magma cools slowly. It contains visible crystals of quartz, feldspar, and mica, resulting in a very hard and durable rock that stands the test of time.",
    "limestone": "Limestone is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of calcite, formed from the accumulation of marine organisms' remains such as shells and corals. Its smooth texture and occasional fossil traces capture the essence of ancient sea environments.",
    "quartzite": "Quartzite is a hard metamorphic rock formed from quartz-rich sandstone that has been transformed by intense heat and pressure. Its shiny, dense surface and excellent resistance to weathering make it one of nature's toughest rocks.",
    "sandstone": "Sandstone is a sedimentary rock formed by the gradual compaction and cementation of sand particles. It comes in a variety of colors and textures, with its appearance reflecting the conditions of its formation over time.",
    "shale": "Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock composed of compacted clay and silt. Known for its tendency to split into thin layers, it provides clear evidence of slow, quiet deposition in low-energy environments.",
    "tuff": "Tuff is a type of rock formed from volcanic ash and debris that have been compacted and solidified after an eruption. Its porous and irregular texture, along with its varied coloration, reflects the explosive nature of its volcanic origin.",
    "chert": "Chert is a very hard sedimentary rock composed of tightly compacted microcrystalline quartz. It typically forms in marine environments and is known for its shiny surface and uniform texture.",
    "diorite": "Diorite is an igneous rock characterized by medium-sized mineral crystals. Formed from relatively rapid cooling of magma, it displays a natural mix of light and dark minerals that create a speckled appearance.",
    "dolomite": "Dolomite is a rock composed mainly of calcium and magnesium carbonate. Similar to limestone but with a distinct chemical makeup, it features a moderately firm surface and subtle texture.",
    "gabbro": "Gabbro is a coarse-grained igneous rock that forms deep underground as magma cools slowly. Typically dark in color, it is extremely durable and retains its structure over long periods.",
    "marl": "Marl is a sedimentary rock formed from a mixture of clay and calcium carbonate. It exhibits a smooth texture with subtle color variations due to the natural blend of fine particles.",
    "obsidian": "Obsidian is a volcanic glass formed when lava cools extremely quickly, resulting in a smooth, glass-like surface with sharp edges.",
    "pumice": "Pumice is a lightweight volcanic rock formed when lava cools rapidly and traps numerous gas bubbles. Its porous structure makes it exceptionally light and gives it a unique, bubbly texture.",
    "rhyolite": "Rhyolite is a volcanic rock with a fine-grained structure formed from quickly cooled lava. It typically exhibits a light tone and is rich in quartz and feldspar.",
    "scoria": "Scoria is a vesicular volcanic rock formed from gas-rich lava that solidifies with many bubbles. It has a rough, porous texture and a dark color that reflects its volcanic origin.",
    "slate": "Slate is a metamorphic rock derived from shale that has been transformed under heat and pressure. It splits easily into thin layers and features a finely foliated structure.",
    "agate": "Agate is a variety of chalcedony known for its unique banded patterns and a range of vibrant colors. Formed over long periods, it features intricate patterns, a glossy surface, and a smooth feel.",
    "calcite": "Calcite is a crystalline rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate. It often forms transparent or translucent crystals that reflect light, displaying various shapes and hues.",
    "feldspar": "Feldspar is one of the most abundant minerals in the Earth's crust, commonly found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. It exhibits a subtle color and a glassy luster, making it a fundamental building block of rocks.",
    "marble": "Marble is a metamorphic rock formed from limestone under high heat and pressure. It is celebrated for its soft colors and distinctive veining, which capture a long geological history.",
    "mica": "Mica is a translucent mineral that splits into thin, shimmering layers. Known for its sparkling surface and smooth texture, it comes in a range of colors that resemble nature's own artwork.",
    "pegmatite": "Pegmatite is an igneous rock characterized by exceptionally large crystals formed as magma cools slowly. Its massive, radiant crystals often resemble gemstones and are highly prized for their beauty.",
    "pyrite": "Pyrite, often nicknamed 'fool's gold', is a mineral with a metallic luster and a brilliant golden appearance. Its distinctive shine and unique crystal shapes make it particularly striking.",
    "quartz": "Quartz is one of the most common minerals on Earth, typically found in transparent or translucent forms with a clean, glossy finish and impressive durability.",
    "sapphire": "Sapphire is a precious gemstone best known for its deep, vivid blue color, though it can also appear in other hues. It is prized for its hardness and elegant shine.",
    "schist": "Schist is a metamorphic rock formed from shale or other rocks that have undergone significant heat and pressure, resulting in a foliated structure. It is marked by visible mineral flakes and a smooth, splintering texture."
